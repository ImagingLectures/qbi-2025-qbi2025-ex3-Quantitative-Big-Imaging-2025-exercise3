# Exercise for lecture 3 - Image Enhancement

## Learning Objectives
- Explore waht filtering does to images
- Filtering and noise
- Filtering performance evaluation

## Preparation
- Accept assignment: 
- Clone your student repository (```git clone```)
- Run `uv sync` and check everything is correct with `uv run hello.py`
- Start Jupyter

## Exercise
1. Evaluate on images the SNR according to different definitions
2. Tune the parameters of different filters in different noise conditions to achieve a target MSE.
